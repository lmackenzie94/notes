React:
- is an **open-source frontend JavaScript library** used for building user interfaces.
- is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. 
- created by Facebook and released in 2013.

## JSX (JavaScript XML)

- JSX is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript. Basically it just provides syntactic sugar for the <code>React.createElement()</code> function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.
